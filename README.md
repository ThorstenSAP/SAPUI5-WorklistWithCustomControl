## Worklist with custom Control
- A simple worklist sample based on the master-detail template
    - The tasks will be stored in the local storage of the webbrowser. By initial loading a local JSONModel with sample data will be written to the local storage.
    - Every change will only be saved to the local storage if the save button on the ToDo-List (TwoColumnLayout) is clicked.
